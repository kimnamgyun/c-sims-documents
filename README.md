# Getting started

C-Sims is a security detection, visibility, and compliance open source project. It was born as a fork of OSSEC HIDS, and later was integrated with Elastic Stack and OpenSCAP, evolving into a more comprehensive solution.

Intelligent continuous attack \(APT\) detection and defense through log big data analysis, verification of detection result through machine learning \(minimization of false positives\) C-SIMS now provides unknown threat analysis and anomaly detection.

Detection rules based on log analysis to compensate for threats and defend against Web attacks. Web application security should be done in real time.

C-SIMS solves the security administrator's concerns about enterprise system management and security.

Detect abnormal behavior of in-house cloud for security of cloud resources. Due to limitations of existing monitoring methods, it takes a lot of time and manpower to perform log analysis to identify the cause of failure. To manage intelligent attacks in advance, use the threat intelligence module to collect logs and analyze information. C-SIMS saves your company costs by providing updates and log collection / detection / analysis services through the Docker.

C-Sims support these lists that are important to understand where the security incidents have started.

*  **Real-time log analysis**
*  **Vulnerability Identification**
*  **Real-time defense**
*  **Report creation**
*  **Real-time alarm service**
*  **Docker Compose**
