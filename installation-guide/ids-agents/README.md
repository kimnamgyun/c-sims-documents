# IDS Agents

### Installing IDS agent

agents are multi-platform and provides the following capabilities:

* log and data collection,
* file integrity monitoring,
* rootkit and malware detection, and
* security policy monitoring.

There are several options to install a IDS agent, depending on the operating system and whether or not you wish to build from source. Consult the table below and choose how to proceed for a given agent:

* RPM packages
* DEB packages
* Window installer

Deploying agents to a large number of servers or endpoints can be easier using automation tools like Puppet, Chef, SCCM or Ansible. Consider exploring these options if you are deploying Agent in a larger environment.
