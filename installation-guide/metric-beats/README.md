# Metric Beats

Metricbeat helps you monitor your servers and the services they host by collecting metrics from the operating system and services.

To get started with your own Metricbeat setup, install and configure these related products:

* Elasticsearch for storing and indexing the data.
* Kibana for the UI.
* Logstash \(optional\) for parsing and enhancing the data.

{% hint style="success" %}
You can skip having to install Elasticsearch and Kibana by using our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud. The Elasticsearch Service is available on AWS, GCP, and Azure. Try out the Elasticsearch Service for free.
{% endhint %}

After installing the Elastic Stack, read the following topics to learn how to install, configure, and run Metricbeat.
