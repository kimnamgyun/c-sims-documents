# Install Metricbeat

You should install Metricbeat as close as possible to the service you want to monitor. For example, if you have four servers with MySQL running, itâ€™s recommended that you run Metricbeat on each server. This allows Metricbeat to access your service from localhost and does not cause any additional network traffic or prevent Metricbeat from collecting metrics when there are network problems. Metrics from multiple Metricbeat instances will be combined on the Elasticsearch server.

If script execution is disabled on your system, you need to set the execution policy for the current session to allow the script to run. For example: `PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy UnRestricted -File .\install-service-metricbeat.ps1`

 Before starting Metricbeat, you should look at the configuration options in the configuration file, for example `C:\Program Files\Metricbeat\metricbeat.yml`
